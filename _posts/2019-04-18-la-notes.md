Linear algebra is a tool of mathematics that is widely used throughout science and engineering.
Yet because linear algebra is a form of continuous rather than discrete mathematics,
many computer scientists have inexperience with it.

## Vector

### Unit-Vector

The normalized vector $$\u{u}$$ of a non-zero vector $$\v{u}$$ is the unit vector in the direction of vector $$\v{u}$$,

### Proof: 

$$
\sigma ::= \mathbb{R}^n \mid \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix}
,\qquad \u{u} \in \sigma ,\qquad \norm{\u{u}} = 1  
$$$$$$

where $$\sigma$$ is the type of vector, $$\u{u}$$ means Unit-Vector, $$\norm{\v{u}}$$ is the [Norm][Norm] that is the magnitude of vector,

$$
\frac{\infer \u{u} : \sigma}
     {\infer k\norm{\u{u}} \equiv k}
$$

$$\Gamma$$ is the context we care about on algebra, and by the way as we know $$\u{u}$$ is a vector, surely $$k\u{u}$$ also is a vector,

$$
\frac{\infer k\norm{\u{u} : \sigma} \equiv k \quad \infer \v{u} : \sigma}
     {\infer \norm{\v{u}} \equiv k}
\qquad \v{u} := k\u{u}
$$

By two step, we got $$\infer \left(k\norm{\u{u}} \equiv k\right) \wedge \left(\norm{\v{u}} \equiv k\right)$$.

Due to $$\u{u} = \frac{k\u{u}}{k}$$, and thence as we can attempt to do some substitute for this:

$$
\frac{\infer k\norm{\u{u} : \sigma} \equiv \norm{\v{u} : \sigma}}
     {\infer \u{u} \equiv \frac{\v{u}}{k\norm{\u{u}}} \equiv \frac{\v{u}}{\norm{\v{u}}}}
$$

Normally denote as: $$\u{u} \equiv \frac{\v{u}}{\norm{\v{u}}}$$.

Apparently, $$\norm{\v{u}}$$ is a [Scalar][Scalar], and apparently so, $$\u{u}$$ is the unit vector in the direction of non-zero vector $$\v{u}$$.
