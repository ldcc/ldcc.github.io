60 年代的美国是社会急剧动荡的年代。种族歧视、贫困和越南战争等各种社会问题和矛盾引发了美国青年对美国社会的极大不满，导致他们鄙视和摒弃美国的传统价值观念。面对一个他们不再信任的社会，美国青年以各种方式表达他们自己的态度和信念。正如本课中所说的，他们当中有些人脱离传统的社会活动，拒绝承担任何社会责任，过着颓废的寄生生活；有些人逃离城市，跑到偏僻的乡间过着原始公社式的生活；有些人则试图以暴力手段改变社会状况，遭到了残酷的镇压。作者认为只有一点一点地改良社会才是青年人应走地道路。读者对这一点应持批判的态度

# <center> Four Choices for Young People
## <center> 年轻人的四个选择

Shorty before his graduation, Jim Binns, president of the senior class at Stanford University, wrote me about some of his misgivings. "More than any other generation," he said, "our generation views the adult world with great skepticism... there is also an increased tendency to reject completely that world."

Apparently he speaks for a lot of his contemporaries. During the last few years, I have listened to scores of young people, in college an out, who were just as nervous about the grown-up world. Roughly, their attitude might be summed up about like this: "The world is in pretty much of a mess, full of injustice, poverty, and war, The people responsible are, presumably, the adults who have been running things. If they can't do better than that, what have they go to teach our generation? That kind of lesson we can do without."

These conclusions strike me as reasonable, at last from their point of view. The relevant question for the arriving generation is not whether our society is imperfect (we can take that for granted), but how to deal with it, For all its harshness and irrationality, it is the only world we've got. Choosing a strategy to cope with it, then, is the first decision young adults
have to make, and usually the most important decision of their lifetime. So far asI have been able to discover, there are only four basic alternative:

## I. Drop Out

This is one of the oldest expedients, and it can be practiced any where, at any age, and with or without the use of hallucinogens. It always has been the strategy of choice for people who find the world too brutal or too complex to be endured. By definition, this way of life is parasitic. In one way or another, its practitioners batten on the society which they scorn and in which they refuse to take any responsibility. Some of us find this distasteful--an undignified kind of life. But for the poor in sprit, wit low levels of both energy and pride, it may be the least intolerable choice available.

## II. Flee

This strategy also has ancient antecedents. ever since civilization began, certain individuals have trie to run away from it in hopes of finding a simpler, more pastoral, and more peaceful life. Unlike the dropouts, they are not parasites. They are willing to support themselves and to contribute something to the general community, but they simple don't like the environment of civilization; that is, the city, with all its ugliness and tension.

The Trouble with this solution is that it no longer is practical on a large scale. Our planet, unfortunately, is running out of noble savages and unsullied landscapes; except for the polar regions, the frontiers are gone. A few gentleman farmers with plenty of money can still escape to the bucolic life--but in general the stream of migration is flowing the other way.

## III. Plot a Revolution

This strategy is always popular among those who have no patience with the tedious workings of the democratic process or who believe that basic institutions can only be changed by force. It attracts some of the more active and idealistic young people of every generation. To them it offers a romantic appeal, usually symbolized by some dashing and charismatic figure.

It has the even greater appeal of simplicity: "Since this society is hopelessly bad, let's smash it and build something better on the ruins."

Some of my best friends have been revolutionists, and a few of them have led reasonably satisfying hves. These are the ones whose revolutions did not come off; they havee been able to keep on cheerfully plotting their holocausts right into their senescence. Others died young, in prison or on the barricades. But the most unfortunate are those whose revolutions have succeeded. They lived, in bitter disillusionment, to see the establishment they had overthrown replaced by a new one, just as hard-faced and stuffy.

I am not, of course, suggesting that revolutions accomplish nothing. Some (the American Revolution, the French Revolution) clearly do change things for the better. My point is merely  that the idealists who make the revolution are bound to be disappointed in either case. For at best their victory never dawns on the shining new world they had dreamed of, cleansed of all human meanness. Instead it dawns on a familiar, workaday place, still in need of groceries and sewage disposal. The revolutionary state, under whatever political label, has to be run--not by violent romantics--but by experts in marketing, sanitary engineering, and the management of bureaucracies. 

For the idealists who are determined to remake society, but who seek a more practical method than armed revolution, there remains one more alternative.

## IV. Try to Change the World Gradually, One Clod at a TIme

At first glance, this course is far form inviting. It lacks glamour. It promised no quick results. It depends on the exasperating and uncertain instruments of quick results. It depends on the exasperating and uncertain instruments of persuasion and democratic decision marking. It demands patience, always in short supply. About all that can be said for it is that it sometimes works-- that in this particular time and place it offers a better chance for remedying some of the world's outranges than any other available strategy.

 So at least the historical evidence seems to suggest. When I was graduating form college, my generation also found the world in a mess. the economic machinery had broken down almost everywhere: In this country nearly a quarter of the population was out of work. A major war seemed all to likely. As a college newspaper editor at that time, I protested against this just as vehemently as student activists are protesting today.

 At the same time, my generation was discovering that reforming the world is a little like fighting a military campaign in the Apennines, as soon as you capture one mountain range, another one looms just ahead. As the big problems of the thirties were brought under some kind of rough control, new problems took their place--the unprecedented problems of an affluent society, of racial justice, of keeping our cities from becoming uninhabitable, of coping with war in unfamiliar guises. Most disturbing of all was our discovery of the population explosion. It dawned on us rather suddenly that the number of passengers on the small spaceship we inhabit is doubling about every forth years. So long as the earth's population keeps growing at this cancerous rate, all of the other problems appear virtually insoluble. Our  cities will continue to become more crowded and noisome. The landscape will get more cluttered, the air and water even dirtier. The quality of life is likely to become steadily worse for everybody. And warfare on a rising scale seems inevitable if too many bodies have to struggle for ever-dwindling shares of food and living space.

 So Jim Binns's generation hasa formidable job on its hands. But not, I think, an insuperable one. On the evidence of the past, it can be handled in the same way that hard problems have been coped with before--piecemeal, pragmatically, by the dogged efforts of many people.

10. __For all its harshness and irrationality, it is the only world we've got.__ --In spite of the fact that the world is cruel and irrational, it is the only world we have.
11. __Drop Out__ --To reject conventional social values and to withdraw from social responsibilities(脱离社会). People who practice this are called dropouts. Students who witdraw from school are also called dropouts.
12. __with or without the use of hallucinogens__ --With or without taking drugs. 60 年代美国青年吸毒成风。 一种叫 LSD 的毒品特别受青年人的青睐，吸食后可产生各种扭曲的幻觉，很多人因此死于非命。
13. __In one way or another, it's practitioners  batten on the society...__ --They benefit from the society in one way or another. 这些青年人拒不承担任何社会责任，什么工作也不做，他们不得不乞讨、抢劫或偷窃、向家里要钱，依赖社会过寄生虫的生活。
14. __But for the poor in spirit... the least intolerable choice available.__ --poor in spirit: 精神懦弱的人。most tolerable choice: 最可忍受的选择。
15. __Flee__ --Here it means to escape from cities to the unspoiled country to live a rather primitive communal life（原始公社生活）.
16. __...except the polar regions, the frontiers are gone.__ --Vey few regions on earth remain unsettled except the Arctic region(北极) and the Antarctic region(南极). 这里的 "Frontier" 不是指国家之间的国界或一个国家的边境、边疆，而是泛指尚无人定居的未开发地区。这个词还可特指美国历史上由东向西逐渐开发的边疆，这种勇于开拓的精神在美国称为拓荒精神(the frontier spirit)。
17. __Our plane, unfortunately, is running out of noble savages and  unsullied landscapes...__ --Unfortunately, there are fewer and fewer noble savages and unspoiled landscapes on earth. Noble savages(专指过着原始生活的文明人)：people who go and live a rather primitive way of life in little explored poor areas and are thus able to keep away from the vice of the civilized world and remain noble.

    the democratic process: 这里指的是美国的民主决策过程。
21. __some dashing and charismatic figure__ --Someone who is energetic and has great popular appeal(某个有闯劲、魅力非凡的人物).
22. __These are the ones whose revolutions did not come off...to keep on cheerfully plotting their holocausts right into their senescence.__ --Their revolutions did not actually take place. They only made secret plans for mass destruction of human lives and stopped at that level, thus bringing no harm to society and themselves. So they were able to keep on doing so till their old age. They cheerfully did so because it satisfied their romantic desires. Note that the word "holocausts" reveals the author's biased attitude towards revolution.
23. __Others died young... on the barricades.__ --In the 1960s, some militant young people, such as the Black Panthers(黑豹党人), took up arms and made barricades on the street, fighting against the police. Many were killed in the street fighting; others were arrested and put into prison.
24. __They lived, in bitter disillusionment, to see the establishment they had overthrown replaced by a new one, just as hard-faced and stuffy.__ --They lived totally disappointed and felt pained to see that the new establishment was just as rigid-looking and dull as the old one.该句中的 "in bitter disillusionment" 说明他们活着的思想状态。句中的 "to see..." 是一个表示结果的动词不定式。注意句中 "to see the establishment...replaced by..." 的用法，它和 "hard-faced and stuffy" 合起来的意思是：发现新机构跟他们所推翻的旧机构一样令人难以忍受。
25. __the American Revolution__ --Also knowns as the War of Independence(独立战争 1775-1783), the armed struggle by which 13 British colonies in North America won independence from Britain and founded the United States of America.

28. __still in need of groceries and sewage disposal__ --这里的 "groceries and sewage disposal" 用来泛指 "the most basic things people need for a decent life"。这句话的意思是：The new establishment brings about nothing extraordinary and romantic; instead, people still live the same old dull life.
29. __by experts in marketing, sanitary engineering, and the management of bureaucracies__ --这里的 "experts in marketing" 接上句的 "in need of groceries" 而来，泛指 "experts in business"；"experts in sanitary engineering" 接上句的 "sewage disposal" 而来，泛指 "experts in all technical matters"；"bureaucracies" 指的是 "government organizations at all levels"。这一部分的意思是：The revolutionary state is the same as the old one, being still run by experts doing technical and professional work in all businesses and public services.
30. __instruments of persuasion and democratic decision making__ --This mainly refers to the American government, the Congress, and lobbying(游说) done by agents of various interest groups(利益集团).
31. __It demands patience, always in short supply.__ --It requires people to be patient, which most people are not. Their patience runs out quickly,
32. __About all that can be said for it is that it sometimes works--that in this...than any other available strategy.__ --The only good point of this method is that it sometimes brings about the desired result. 破折号后面的 that 引导的从句补充说明这个办法如何行得通。
33. __So at least the historical evidence seems to suggest.__ --"So" 是 "suggest" 的宾语，指的是上一句里讲到的情况，放在句首有承上启下的作用。
34. __The economic machinery had broken down almost every-where...__ --The economic machinery means the economic system. 1929 年美国股市暴跌，引发了 30 年代波及西方世界各国的严重经济危机。在美国，这场长达 10 年的危机迫使数千家银行倒闭，进出口急剧下降，商业萧条，一千七百多万工人失业。美国人把这场危机称作 "the Great Depression"(大萧条)。
35. __A major war seemed all too likely.__ --This refers to the Second World War(193-1945), which was very likely to break out.
36. __the Apennines__ --亚平宁山脉是意大利半岛的主干山脉。第二次世界大战期间，在意大利于 1932 年 9 月宣布投降之后，驻守在意大利的德军凭借复杂的山地地形负隅顽抗，使英美联盟军的进军一时收到阻拦。
37. __war in unfamiliar guises__ --War taking forms unfamiliar to people at that time. 当时的这一类战争包括以遏制和削弱共产主义国家力量为名的冷战和打着捍卫民主和遏制共产主义扩散的旗号而进行的越南战争，甚至包括约翰逊政府于 1964 年在美国国内发起的所谓 "向贫穷宣战(the War on Poverty)"
38. __Most disturbing of all was our discovery of th population explosion.__ --The world population reached 3 billion in 1960 with a shocking growth rate exceeding two percent. In the United States, there was a baby boom(生育高峰期) after the Second World War. These post-war babies grew up in the 1960s. The rapidly increasing number of the young easily led Americans to their sudden discovery of the population explosion(人口爆炸是人口激增的夸张说法) both at home and in the rest of th world.
39. __the small spaceship we inhabit__ --a metaphorical(隐喻的) way of referring to the earth.
40. __And warfare on a rising scale seems inevitable...__ --Armed conflict on a larger and larger scale, that is, war, seems unavoidable. 这反映了马尔萨斯人口论的观点。托马斯·马尔萨斯(Thomas Malthus, 1766~1834) 是英国经济学家，近代人口问题研究的先驱。他认为：人口增长的趋势永远快于生产的增长。如果不加限制，人口总是按几何级数增长而生产力只能按算术级增长。人口扩张到生产力能维持的极限时，就会出现饥饿、战争、疾病（然而我在看到这篇文章的现在是 2023 年 6 月，中国人口已经出现负增长了，只能说认真你就输了）.
