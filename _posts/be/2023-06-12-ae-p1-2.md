60 年代的美国是社会急剧动荡的年代。种族歧视、贫困和越南战争等各种社会问题和矛盾引发了美国青年对美国社会的极大不满，导致他们鄙视和摒弃美国的传统价值观念。面对一个他们不再信任的社会，美国青年以各种方式表达他们自己的态度和信念。正如本课中所说的，他们当中有些人脱离传统的社会活动，拒绝承担任何社会责任，过着颓废的寄生生活；有些人逃离城市，跑到偏僻的乡间过着原始公社式的生活；有些人则试图以暴力手段改变社会状况，遭到了残酷的镇压。作者认为只有一点一点地改良社会才是青年人应走地道路。读者对这一点应持批判的态度

# <center> Four Choices for Young People

Shorty before his graduation, Jim Binns, president of the senior class at Stanford University, wrote me about some of his misgivings. "More than any other generation," he said, "our generation views the adult world with great skepticism... there is also an increased tendency to reject completely that world."

Apparently he speaks for a lot of his contemporaries. During the last few years, I have listened to scores of young people, in college an out, who were just as nervous about the grown-up world. Roughly, their attitude might be summed up about like this: "The world is in pretty much of a mess, full of injustice, poverty, and war, The people responsible are, presumably, the adults who have been running things. If they can't do better than that, what have they go to teach our generation? That kind of lesson we can do without."

These conclusions strike me as reasonable, at last from their point of view. The relevant question for the arriving generation is not whether our society is imperfect (we can take that for granted), but how to deal with it, For all its harshness and irrationality, it is the only world we've got. Choosing a strategy to cope with it, then, is the first decision young adults
have to make, and usually the most important decision of their lifetime. So far asI have been able to discover, there are only four basic alternative:

## I. Drop Out

This is one of the oldest expedients, and it can be practiced any where, at any age, and with or without the use of hallucinogens. It always has been the strategy of choice for people who find the world too brutal or too complex to be endured. By definition, this way of life is parasitic. In one way or another, its practitioners batten on the society which they scorn and in which they refuse to take any responsibility. Some of us find this distasteful--an undignified kind of life. But for the poor in sprit, wit low levels of both energy and pride, it may be the least intolerable choice available.

## II. Flee

This strategy also has ancient antecedents. ever since civilization began, certain individuals have trie to run away from it in hopes of finding a simpler, more pastoral, and more peaceful life. Unlike the dropouts, they are not parasites. They are willing to support themselves and to contribute something to the general community, but they simple don't like the environment of civilization; that is, the city, with all its ugliness and tension.

The Trouble with this solution is that it no longer is practical on a large scale. Our planet, unfortunately, is running out of noble savages and unsullied landscapes; except for the polar regions, the frontiers are gone. A few gentleman farmers with plenty of money can still escape to the bucolic life--but in general the stream of migration is flowing the other way.

## III. Plot a Revolution

This strategy is always popular among those who have no patience with the tedious workings of the democratic process or who believe that basic institutions can only be changed by force. It attracts some of the more active and idealistic young people of every generation. To them it offers a romantic appeal, usually symbolized by some dashing and charismatic figure.

It has the even greater appeal of simplicity: "Since this society is hopelessly bad, let's smash it and build something better on the ruins."

Some of my best friends have been revolutionists, and a few of them have led reasonably satisfying hves. These are the ones whose revolutions did not come off; they havee been able to keep on cheerfully plotting their holocausts right into their senescence. Others died young, in prison or on the barricades. But the most unfortunate are those whose revolutions have succeeded. They lived, in bitter disillusionment, to see the establishment they had overthrown replaced by a new one, just as hard-faced and stuffy.

I am not, of course, suggesting that revolutions accomplish nothing. Some (the American Revolution, the French Revolution) clearly do change things for the better. My point is merely  that the idealists who make the revolution are bound to be disappointed in either case. For at best their victory never dawns on the shining new world they had dreamed of, cleansed of all human meanness. Instead it dawns on a familiar, workaday place, still in need of groceries and sewage disposal. The revolutionary state, under whatever political label, has to be run--not by violent romantics--but by experts in marketing, sanitary engineering, and the management of bureaucracies. 

For the idealists who are determined to remake society, but who seek a more practical method than armed revolution, there remains one more alternative.

## IV. Try to Change the World Gradually, One Clod at a TIme

At first glance, this course is far form inviting. It lacks glamour. It promised no quick results. It depends on the exasperating and uncertain instruments of quick results. It depends on the exasperating and uncertain instruments of persuasion and democratic decision marking. It demands patience, always in short supply. About all that can be said for it is that it sometimes works-- that in this particular time and place it offers a better chance for remedying some of the world's outranges than any other available strategy.

 So at least the historical evidence seems to suggest. When I was graduating form college, my generation also found the world in a mess. the economic machinery had broken down almost everywhere: In this country nearly a quarter of the population was out of work. A major war seemed all to likely. As a college newspaper editor at that time, I protested against this just as vehemently as student activists are protesting today.

 At the same time, my generation was discovering that reforming the world is a little like fighting a military campaign in the Apennines, as soon as you capture one mountain range, another one looms just ahead. As the big problems of the thirties were brought under some kind of rough control, new problems took their place--the unprecedented problems of an affluent society, of racial justice, of keeping our cities from becoming uninhabitable, of coping with war in unfamiliar guises. Most disturbing of all was our discovery of the population explosion. It dawned on us rather suddenly that the number of passengers on the small spaceship we inhabit is doubling about every forth years. So long as the earth's population keeps growing at this cancerous rate, all of the other problems appear virtually insoluble. Our  cities will continue to become more crowded and noisome. The landscape will get more cluttered, the air and water even dirtier. The quality of life is likely to become steadily worse for everybody. And warfare on a rising scale seems inevitable if too many bodies have to struggle for ever-dwindling shares of food and living space.

 So Jim Binns's generation hasa formidable job on its hands. But not, I think, an insuperable one. On the evidence of the past, it can be handled in the same way that hard problems have been coped with before--piecemeal, pragmatically, by the dogged efforts of many people.

 6. __full of injustice, poverty, and war__ --在 60 年代的历史背景下，"injustice" 主要指的是对黑人的种族歧视(racial discrimination against blacks)。"poverty" 指的是生活在贫困线以下的美国人。美国社会学家迈克尔·哈林顿(Michael Harrington)在 1962 年出版的《另一个美国》（The Other America）一书中第一次披露，美国有五千多万穷人过着贫苦的日子，从此，人们广泛地认识到富裕的美国依然存在贫困。"war" 指的是越南战争。美国从 1961 年派兵侵略越南，战争逐步升级，于 1973 年以失败告终，共死亡五万六千多名官兵，耗资一千五百多万美元。
 7. __what have they got to teach out generation?__这是一个修辞性疑问句，用来强调要表达的意思。这一句强调的意思是：They have got nothing to teach our generation.
 8. __That kind of lesson we can do without.__ --We don't need that kind of instructions, for we can manage things by ourselves without them. 这句话的正常语序是：We can do without that kind of lesson. to do without: 不需要，没有也行。
 9. __The relevant question...is not whether...(we can take that for granted)...but how...__ --珠姨这一句中的 not...but... 的结构，其意思为“不是……而是……”。 take something for granted 意思是视某事为当然。
