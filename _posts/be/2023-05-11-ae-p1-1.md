这篇课文选自美国 1974 年的一期高中生杂志（Senior Scholatic），作者在文中着重从社会学的角度探讨摇滚乐的社会意义。在文章的头三段里，作者以相同的手法描写了三位摇滚歌星的表演盛况。青少年把他们视为偶像，赞美不绝，而成年观众则觉得他们恶心，难以忍受，这反映了青少年和成人社会对摇滚乐截然不同的态度。接着作者引用社会学家和音乐家的话，指出摇滚乐是“一种社会心理的表现”，它“表现其时代”，是各种思想交锋的场所。在这个辩论的论坛上，摇滚歌星们不但表达了青少年对各种政治与社会问题的立场和观点，帮助社会解释其信仰与态度，而且也表达了青少年的情感和愿望。作者在文章的结尾中又提出副标题里的问题，旨在鼓励读者认真思考这个问题。

It was mid-June, 197, the Chicago Amphitheater was packed, sweltering, rocking. Onstage, Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones was singing "Midnight Rambler". Critic Don Heckman was there when the song ended. "Jagger," he said, "grabs a half gallon jug of water and runs along the front platform, sprinkling its contents over the first few rows of sweltering listeners. They surge to follow him, eager to be touched by a few baptismal drops."

It was late December, 1973. Som 14,000 screaming fans were crunching up to the front of the stage at Capital Center, outside Washington, D.C. Alice Cooper, America's singing ghoul, was ending his act. He ends it by pretending to end his life -- with a guillotine. His "head" drops into a straw basket. "Ooh," gasped a girl dressed in black. "Oh, isn't that marvelous?" Fourteen-year-old Mike Perlie was there too, but his parent  weren't. "They think he's sick, sick, sick," Mike said, "They say to me, 'How can you stand that stuff?'"

I was late January, 1974. Inside the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, Bob Dylan and The Band were tuning for a concert. Outside, in the pouring rain, fan Chris Singer was waiting to get in. "This is pilgrimage," Chris said. "I ought to be crawling on my knees."

How do you feel about all this adulation and hero worship? When Mick Jagger's fans look at him as a high priest or a god, are you with them or against them? Do you share Chris Singer's almost religious reverence for Bob Dylan? Do you thing he--or Dylan--is misguided? Do you reject Alice cooper as sick? Or are you drawn somehow to this strange clown, perhaps because he acts out your wildest fantasies?

These aren't  idle questions. Some sociologists say that your answers to them could explain a lot about what you are thinking and about what your society is thinking--in other words, about where you and your society are. "Music expresses its times," says sociologist Irving Horowitz. Horowitz sees the rock music arena as a sort of debating forum, a place where ideas clash and crash. He sees it as a place where American society struggles to define and redefine its feelings and beliefs. "The redefinition," Horowitz says, "it a task uniquely performed by the young. It is they alone who combine invention and exaggeration, reason and motion, word and sound, music and politics."
